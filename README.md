## Work Experience  

### **Research Analyst @ Health Technology Lab, Indiana University** *(April 2024 - December 2024)*  
***Capstone - Spatio-cognitive abilities and its association with executive functions: A Study using Virtual Reality*** 
- Analyzed VR based real-time data from young adults to investigate the relationship between spatio-cognitive abilities and executive functioning, with performance compared across distinct levels of visual complexity.    
- Processed movement data (position coordinates, quaternions), action data (sensor-based actions), and step completion timestamps to track participant interactions in real time. 
- Extracted 300+ features representing executive functions from participant performance in VR tasks and analyzed their associations with spatial skills using statistical methods.  
- Selected key features through ReliefF and Correlation based attribute evaluation to predict spatio-cognitive scores.  
- Achieved 67% accuracy in predicting an individualâ€™s spatio-cognitive score across simple and complex visual environments using different ML algorithms.  
Skills: Data Collection, Preprocessing, Statistical Analysis, Feature Extraction & Selection, ML Modeling

### **Research Analyst @ PLHI Lab , Indiana University** *(August 2023 - April 2024)*  
***Datathon Impact Analysis and Visualization Dashboard*** 
- Developed an interactive dashboard using Python, Django, Plotly and SQL to track and analyze the impact of Health Datathons, focusing on the increase in publications resulting from author collaborations during these events.  
- Analyzed over 6,400 rows of author details, highlighting year-over-year changes in publications. Automated the search process, achieving a 100% reduction in manual queries. 
Database Management: Imported data into SQLite by creating Django models to merge data.   

***DHIS2 - Immunization Registry for newborns and mothers in Nigeria***
Designed a mobile application using DHIS2 to create an immunization registry system encompassing newborn registration, vaccination scheduling, and tracking functionalities, while also implementing a robust dashboard and reporting system to enhance public health data management by monitoring immunization coverage, adverse reactions, and growth metrics.

### **EHR Intern @ Kasturba Hospital, Manipal** *(December 2020 - March 2023)*  
- Participated in the EMR implementation UBQmedics, investigated the HIMS software, and contributed to the transition from paper-based to electronic health records. Assisted in the annual auditing process for National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers (NABH) accreditation. 
- Collaborated on quality evaluations in the Out-Patient Department to enhance patient care, led mock drills to improve hospital readiness for critical incidents, and managed medical records to ensure compliance and secure handling of confidential data.
